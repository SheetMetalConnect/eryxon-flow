- **Time Tracking**: Start, pause, resume timing with actual vs estimated comparison
- **QRM Capacity**: WIP limits, capacity warnings, and bottleneck prevention
- **Operator Terminal**: Touch-optimized interface for shop floor tablets
- **3D CAD Viewer**: View STEP files directly in browser with Three.js
- **Issue Management**: Quality issue reporting with photo capture
- **Multi-Language**: English, Dutch, German with i18next support
- **REST API**: Complete API for ERP integration with webhooks
- **Multi-Tenant**: Row-level security for SaaS deployments

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
