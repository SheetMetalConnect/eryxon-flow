## Overview

A browser-based 3D STEP file viewer integrated into the EryxonFlow parts management system. Built with React, Three.js, and occt-import-js to parse and render CAD models directly in the browser.

## Features

✅ **STEP File Support**: Parse and render .step and .stp files
✅ **Interactive 3D Controls**: Orbit, zoom, and pan with mouse/touch
✅ **Exploded View**: Visualize assemblies with adjustable separation
✅ **Wireframe Mode**: Toggle between solid and wireframe rendering
✅ **Dynamic Grid**: Auto-sized grid based on model dimensions
✅ **Fit to View**: Automatically frame the model in the viewport
✅ **File Management**: Upload, view, and delete CAD files
✅ **Multi-tenant**: Secure tenant-isolated file storage

## Technology Stack

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "three": "^0.180.0"
}
```

### External Libraries (CDN)
- **occt-import-js** (v0.0.23): STEP file parser loaded from CDN

### Existing Dependencies
- `@radix-ui/react-dialog`: Modal dialogs
- `@radix-ui/react-slider`: Explosion factor control
- `lucide-react`: Icons
- `@supabase/supabase-js`: File storage

## Database Setup

### 1. Create Supabase Storage Bucket

Create a storage bucket called `parts-cad` for storing STEP files.

**Via Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to Storage > Buckets
2. Click "Create bucket"
3. Name: `parts-cad`
4. Public: `false` (private bucket - files accessed via signed URLs)
5. Click "Create bucket"

**Via SQL (Alternative):**
```sql
-- Create storage bucket for parts CAD files
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'parts-cad',
  'parts-cad',
  false,
  52428800, -- 50MB max file size
  ARRAY['application/step', 'application/stp', 'application/octet-stream']
);
```

### 2. Set Up Storage Policies

Add RLS (Row Level Security) policies for the `parts-cad` bucket:

```sql
-- Policy: Allow authenticated users to upload files to their tenant's folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload CAD files to their tenant folder"
ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'parts-cad' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = get_user_tenant_id()::text
);

-- Policy: Allow authenticated users to read files from their tenant's folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can view CAD files from their tenant"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'parts-cad' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = get_user_tenant_id()::text
);

-- Policy: Allow authenticated users to delete files from their tenant's folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete CAD files from their tenant"
ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'parts-cad' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = get_user_tenant_id()::text
);
```

### 3. Verify Parts Table Schema

The `parts` table should already have the `file_paths` column (as TEXT[]). Verify it exists:

```sql
-- Check if file_paths column exists
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'parts' AND column_name = 'file_paths';

-- If it doesn't exist, add it:
ALTER TABLE parts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS file_paths TEXT[];
```

### 4. Create Helper Function

Create a helper function to get user's tenant ID:

```sql
-- Function to get current user's tenant ID
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_tenant_id()
RETURNS UUID
LANGUAGE sql
SECURITY DEFINER
STABLE
AS $$
  SELECT tenant_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()
$$;
```

### Storage Structure

Files are stored in the following structure:
```
parts-cad/
  └── {tenant_id}/
      └── parts/
          └── {part_id}/
              ├── model_v1.step
              ├── assembly.stp
              └── ...
```

## Architecture

```
User opens Part Detail Modal
    ↓
Clicks on existing STEP file OR uploads new file
    ↓
File uploaded to Supabase storage: parts-cad/{tenant_id}/parts/{part_id}/
    ↓
File path saved to parts.file_paths[]
    ↓
User clicks "View 3D" button
    ↓
Create signed URL → Fetch as blob → Create blob URL
    ↓
Opens STEPViewer component in Dialog
    ↓
STEPViewer loads occt-import-js from CDN
    ↓
Initializes Three.js scene (camera, renderer, lights, controls)
    ↓
Fetches STEP file → Convert to ArrayBuffer → Parse with occt-import-js
    ↓
Convert parsed meshes to Three.js geometry
    ↓
Add to scene → Fit camera → Render loop
```

## Key Components

### STEPViewer Component
**Location**: `/src/components/STEPViewer.tsx`

Main 3D viewer component with:
- Three.js scene initialization
- STEP file parsing with occt-import-js
- Interactive controls (orbit, zoom, pan)
- Feature toggles (wireframe, grid, exploded view)
- Loading states and error handling

**Props:**
```typescript
interface STEPViewerProps {
  url: string;      // Blob URL to STEP file
  title?: string;   // Display title
}
```

**Features:**
- 🎮 **Orbit Controls**: Click-drag to rotate, scroll to zoom, right-click-drag to pan
- 📦 **Exploded View**: Separate parts with adjustable factor (0-2x)
- 🔲 **Wireframe Mode**: Toggle between solid and wireframe rendering
- 📐 **Dynamic Grid**: Auto-sized based on model dimensions
- 🎯 **Fit to View**: Automatically center and frame the model
- ⚡ **Optimized**: Efficient rendering with requestAnimationFrame

### PartDetailModal (Modified)
**Location**: `/src/components/admin/PartDetailModal.tsx`

Added sections:
- **CAD Files Upload**: Drag-and-drop file uploader for .step/.stp files
- **CAD Files List**: Display existing files with View/Delete actions
- **3D Viewer Dialog**: Full-screen modal for STEPViewer component

## Usage

## API Reference

### STEPViewer Component

```typescript
import { STEPViewer } from '@/components/STEPViewer';

<STEPViewer
  url="blob:http://localhost:5173/abc123"  // Blob URL to STEP file
  title="Bracket Assembly"                 // Optional display title
/>
```

## Security

### Tenant Isolation
- Files stored in tenant-specific folders: `{tenant_id}/parts/{part_id}/`
- RLS policies restrict access to user's tenant only
- Signed URLs expire after 1 hour

### File Validation
- Client-side: Only .step and .stp extensions allowed
- Server-side: RLS policies enforce tenant access
- MIME types: `application/step`, `application/stp`, `application/octet-stream`

### Storage Policies
All storage operations are protected by RLS policies that enforce tenant isolation.

## Performance Considerations

### File Size Limits
- **Maximum file size**: 50MB per file
- **Recommended**: Keep files under 10MB for optimal performance
- **Large assemblies**: Consider splitting into sub-assemblies

### Rendering Optimization
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth rendering
- Damped controls reduce unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient geometry disposal on cleanup
- Anti-aliasing enabled for better visual quality

### Memory Management
- Blob URLs revoked on dialog close
- Three.js geometries and materials disposed on unmount
- Animation frame cancelled on cleanup

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to load STEP parser library"
**Solution**: Check internet connection, occt-import-js CDN may be down

### Issue: "No geometry found in STEP file"
**Causes**:
- Corrupt STEP file
- Unsupported STEP version (AP242, AP214, etc.)
- Empty or invalid file

**Solution**: Verify file is valid STEP format, try re-exporting from CAD software

### Issue: Model appears off-center
**Solution**: Click "Fit View" button

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution**: We fetch signed URLs as blobs to avoid CORS issues

### Issue: Memory leaks
**Solution**: Always revoke blob URLs when closing the viewer
